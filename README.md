# ML Assignment 2

## Problem Statement
Implement 6 classification models on a dataset from UCI/Kaggle and compare their performance.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from UCI ML Repository.

## Models Implemented
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree  
3. K-Nearest Neighbor  
4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)  
5. Random Forest  
6. XGBoost  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- AUC Score  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- MCC
