The task involves building an interactive Streamlit web application that allows users to upload test data, select models, and view evaluation metrics. The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, UI development, and deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud.\n","\n","## Dataset Description\n","We selected the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  \n","- **Instances:** 569 patient records  \n","- **Features:** 30 numeric attributes describing cell nuclei characteristics (e.g., radius, texture, concavity, symmetry)  \n","- **Target Variable:** Binary classification — Malignant (1) vs. Benign (0)  \n","- **Rationale:** The dataset is widely used for benchmarking classification algorithms, contains sufficient features (>12), and meets the minimum instance requirement (>500). Its balanced distribution ensures reliable evaluation across models."],"metadata":{"id":"OBSSFynlT124"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":342},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1365,"status":"ok","timestamp":1771142406844,"user":{"displayName":"SHUBAM
